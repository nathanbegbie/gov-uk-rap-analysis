```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(googlesheets4)

# 

library(wordcloud)
```

## RAP in Government

we'd like to include the ...

```{r}
# https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/articles/articles/auth.html#sheets_deauth
sheets_deauth()

sheet_url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pwbcXwuMT4zignv5hghDS-eMxTkogwpX8Bt3bCL7SSA/edit#gid=1796469886"
data <- sheets_read(sheet_url)
colnames(data)
```

Great! we have the spreadsheets, let's get the column with the descriptions.
Let's get the `"Please provide a brief outline of the example"` column and use that list of words to feed in to the workd cloud library

```{r}
list_of_words <- unlist(strsplit(data$`Please provide a brief outline of the example`, " "))
head(list_of_words)
```

Finally, let's use the wordcloud library

```{r}
wordcloud(list_of_words, max.words = 50)
```
